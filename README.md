## 🧩 Template Code
**Disclaimer:** This template is what I personally use for developing website, you can create your own framework by trying your layout for different screen sizes and then selecting respective breakpoints.

```css
/* CSS Media Queries template for different screen sizes (with example device given for each screen size) */

/* Category: Large Screens
   Device: iMac (27-inch)

*/

/* --> For screen sizes greater than 1536px, comes the Large Screens category */

/* Category: Large Laptops
   Device: Macbook Pro (14-inch)
   Screen Size: 1512px
*/
@media (max-width: 1536px) {
    /* some styles */
}

/* Category: Small Laptops
   Device: Dell XPS 13 (13.4-inch)

@media (max-width: 1280px) {
    /* some styles */
